# PWA: Pomodoro Timer

### Why create yet another timer?

Primarily I built this to experiment with [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps), and the timer makes for a small yet useful demo.

Thanks to a [Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) and [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), the timer is:

- **Installable**: Add it to your home screen, sitting right alongside native apps.
- **Network-Independent**: Use even whilst offline with resource precaching.

*Note: PWA browser support is varied at this time.*

### What is the purpose of a pomodoro timer?

To break tasks down in to 25 minute intervals (pomodoros) of focused effort, separated by short breaks.
